# Universal Deployer

A tool to generate single-use keyless transactions to deploy smart contracts across chains. It uses a process similar to [Nick's method](https://weka.medium.com/how-to-send-ether-to-11-440-people-187e332566b7):
- Build a transaction to deploy the given contract
- Generate a random valid signature for the transaction   
- Reverse-lookup the address that "signed" the transaction
    - Note the private key for this address is verifiably unknown (signatures generated by this tool have at least 31 bytes of all 1s)

Once finishing this process, the deployer only needs to send some ETH to this single-use address and send the raw transaction to the blockchain of their choice.

## Features
- Light vanity address generation
    - Specify a prefix in the CLI
    - Specify a number of 0-bytes
    - NOTE: these apply to the deployed contract, _not_ the single-use address

## Usage
```bash

universal-deployer 0.1.0
Tool to generate single-use keyless contract deployment transactions

USAGE:
    universal-deployer [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -a, --artifact <artifact>                    Path to a compiled contract artifact
    -b, --bytecode <bytecode>                    The bytecode of the contract to deploy
    -c, --constructor-args <constructor-args>    ABI encoded constructor args to pass to the deployment
        --gas-limit <gas-limit>
            The gas limit to use for the transaction. Recommended to use a generally overestimated limit to allow
            confirmation on many chains [default: 1000000]
        --gas-price <gas-price>
            The gas price to use for the transaction. Recommended to use a generally high price to allow confirmation on
            many chains [default: 100000000000]
    -n, --num-zero-bytes <num-zero-bytes>        The number of zero bytes to exist in the deployed contract address
    -p, --prefix <prefix>                        A prefix for the deployed contract address
    -s, --s-start <s-start>
            The S value to start with, useful when running multiple instances to grind
```
